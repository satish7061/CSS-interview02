    <h3> 8. What is box sizing? </h3>
    <p> 
        Box sizing is a property defines how the width and height get applied on the element. Box-sizing property 
        allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height. By default, the width 
        and height of an element is calculated like this: width + padding + border = actual width of an element
        height + padding + border = actual height of an element. So we set box-sizing as border box so it doesn't 
        include padding and border in the actual width and height.
    </p>

        <div class="container-main-box1">
            <h3>Content Box</h3>
            <p>Actual width/height = width/height + padding(right+left) + border(right+left)</p>
            <P>width = 250 + 0 + 0</P>
            <P>height = 240 + 0 + 0</P>
        </div>
        <div class="container-main-box2">
            <h3>Border Box</h3>
            <p>Actual width/height = width/height - padding(right+left) - border(right+left)</p>
            <P>width = 250 - 10 - 4 = 236</P>
            <P>height = 240 - 10 - 4 = 226</P>

    <h3> 9. What is animation delay? </h3>
    <p> 
        Animation  delay is a sub property of css animation. It is defined that how long the animation should wait 
        by specifying the number of second and milliseconds before starting. The animation-delay CSS property specifies 
        the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the animation. 
        The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.

    <h3> 12. Explain CSS box model? </h3>
    <p> 
        Box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser. It us mostly referred when we design some 
        page or layout. It basically allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
        It is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, 
        and the actual content. 
<pre>
    <strong>Content -> </strong> The content of the box, where text and images appear. 
    <strong>Padding -> </strong> Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
    <strong>Border -> </strong> A border that goes around the padding and content.
    <strong>Margin -> </strong> Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.   
</pre>
         
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="container-box6">
            <p class="box6-para"> Light green is padding 30px each side, dark green is the border of 30px each side and the white space is 30px margin each side. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3> 13. what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden? </h3>
    <p> 
        Display none and visibility hidden both are used to hide the elements. The main difference is display 
        none doesn't take any space and is hidden but visibility hidden gets up its original space and is not 
        visible too.
    </p>
    <div class="container"> 
        <div class="container-box5">
            <h3>Visibility : hidden;</h3>
            <p class="visible">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
             <p> visibility hidden gets up its original space and is not 
                visible</p>
            <h3>Display : none;</h3>
            <p class="display">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aut sunt commodi rerum corporis</p>
            <p>display none doesn't take any space and is hidden</p>
